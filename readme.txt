================================

How to deploy on Netlify (drag & drop):
1) Log in to Netlify.
2) Go to "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually".
3) Drag this folder (or the ZIP) into the drop area.
4) Netlify will publish it instantly and give you a *.netlify.app URL.

Customisation:
- Replace the hero/lifestyle placeholders with your images (edit index.html).
- Update the agent phone number and any copy.
- Travel time ranges are approximate; tweak as you like.
- Tailwind Play CDN is used, so no build step required.
